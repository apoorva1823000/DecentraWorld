# DecentraWorld
## Welcome to India 2.0
### New Decentralized India

<hr/>
In the real world, there are many centrally powered activities such as voting for the government, registering police complaints, crowdfunding etc... The issue with these important parts of lives being controlled centrally is that as there is one ruler, so is the power of its destruction.
<br/>
LoopBreakers brings to you DecentraWorld. A small new world exclusively for you. If you want to conduct elections and have a fair vote, we have you covered with our Voting dApp. Facing any harassment and wishing to register a police complaint but are afraid that you may not get a timely judicious solution to your problem? DecentraWorld has its own dedicated decentralized FIR portal wherein anyone worldwide can ensure you receive the justice you deserve. Want to get funded for any proposal? Welcome to HelpFundMe, a decentralized crowdfunding platform provided by DecentraWorld wherein if you have an environment-friendly proposal then you may also receive NFT for your contribution to the betterment of this world. Well, we also understand the need for fun in life, as a member of DecentraWorld you can try your luck with our decentralized lottery gaming system and who knows you might be the next big name. If you wish to save your data on a decentralized drive, we provide you with that too. And as we all know, modern life is empty without a social media platform so we also bring to you your very own decentralized Twitter wherein you can deploy your tweets as mintable NFTs, own your tweets and sell them too.
<br/>
If you like this new world, you can always support The LoopBreakers and hence DecentraWorld by buying me a decentralized coffee and don't forget to leave a sweet note or your honest review. Yes, you heard that right we have our own Decentralized BMC portal too.
