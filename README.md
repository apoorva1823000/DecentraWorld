# DecentraWorld
## Welcome to India 2.0
### New Decentralized India

<hr/>
In the real world, there are many centrally powered activities such as voting for the government, registering police complaints, crowdfunding etc... The issue with these important parts of lives being controlled centrally is that as there is one ruler, so is the power of its destruction.
For example, we often hear about booth capturing during voting or complaints against some big celebrity not getting registered or looked upon well these are some of the negative marks on existing system. In game of lottery we often hear about biased results. 
<br/><br/>
LoopBreakers brings to you DecentraWorld. A small new world exclusively for you. 
<b>If you want to conduct elections and have fair votings </b>:<br/> we have you covered with our Voting dApp. There is also a demo in the youtube video for the same of which the link is attached below. You can effectively conduct decentralized voting that ensure justified results along with flexibility of conducting elections anywhere anytime owing to its digital nature rather than spending a fortune in establishing voting units and polls.<br/>
<b>Facing any harassment and wishing to register a police complaint but are afraid that you may not get a timely judicious solution to your problem?</b><br/> DecentraWorld has its own dedicated decentralized FIR portal wherein anyone worldwide can ensure you receive the justice you deserve. Decentralization will empower the people to raise voice against crime without fear of being unheard or crushed by corruptions.<br/> 
Want to get funded for any proposal? Welcome to <b>HelpFundMe v2.0 </b>, a decentralized crowdfunding platform provided by DecentraWorld wherein if you have an environment-friendly proposal then you may also receive NFT for your contribution to the betterment of this world. Put a request, mention the timeframe and viola, you get funded by the world and as mentioned above if your request is worthy and by that we mean if the request for fund is to ensure protection of mankind, we'll reward you.<br/>

And as we all know, modern life is empty without a social media platform so we also bring to you your very own <b>decentralized Twitter</b> wherein you can deploy your tweets as mintable NFTs, own your tweets and sell them too.
